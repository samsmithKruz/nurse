        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>
          Nurses who are driven to practice in the United States fail to achieve
          this because they are poorly informed about the process. Some other
          Nurses simply lack the enthusiasm to embark on the journey due to
          factors such as;
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Misinformation about the entire process.</li>
          <li>Poor Financial Strength to sponsor themselves for the NCLEX.</li>
          <li>
            The oppressive requirements and standards of the US Recruitment
            Agencies which makes it hard for a good number of the Nigerian
            Nursing population to qualify.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fear of the NCLEX. Most nurses are overwhelmed by the exam already,
            as they have heard a lot of ill comments about its success rate.
          </li>
          <li>Time duration required to complete the entire process.</li>
          <li>Some donâ€™t just believe it is real.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          These factors might seem intangible or somewhat unrealistic but has completely dashed the hope of young vibrant Nigerian nurses of great intellectual capacity and exceptional passion for the health field, to thrive for greater opportunities. They remain boxed up in a work environment that allows little or less career advancement with nil regard for the role they play in the hospitals and the community at large, not to talk of the low income they are made to live by.
        </p>
        <h4>THE SOLUTION</h4>
        <p>
          I devised a problem solving approach uniquely birthed from my journey so far to be licensed to practice as a United States Registered Nurse. This is based on my firsthand experience and I believe this will go a long way in helping a large number of aspiring USRNs on their journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          The team is made up of experienced, Nigerian USRNs from different Board of Nursing in the United States and also Information Technology experts to help bring this to a globalized stand point. We have among the crew; Nurses who sponsored themselves for the NCLEX, those who started from scratch with Agencies; Nigerian Nurses already practicing in the USA, those who are still on the wait for their immigration processes, Nurses with different Academic qualification, Nurses from different socioeconomic background and more in diversity.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is to ensure we cut across a large number of the Nigerian Nursing population and the unique situation they all might bring to the table. We believe this would pose as a great avenue to enrich mentally, motivate and propel to get on that road to greatness. To fix this problem, we offer;
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Consult with Experts, for help at all stages of the licensure and credentialing process. Example; CGFNS Registration, BON registration, Criminal Background Checks, Pearson Vue, Visa Application and more.
          </li>
          <li>
          NCLEX Review program using Virtual Classrooms to cut across a larger number of interested applicants.
        </li>
        <li>Assistance with the different Payment methods the licensure process might require. For Example Money Order, Credit card transactions.
        </li>
        <li>24/7 Access to a Customer Care Representative.
        </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Vision</h4>
        <p>
          Nigerian Nurses fulfilled in their respective Nursing career; positively influencing the healthcare system both home and away, achieving maximum professional advancement, whilst they live their American dream.
        </p>
        <h4>Mision</h4>
        <p>
          SajPointe Academy stands to bridge that seemingly large gap between Nigerian Nurses and their dream to practice in the USA. We choose to Empower Nurses through the provision of valid information, support, constant motivation and unique guidance to embark on the said Journey.
        </p>
        <h4>Objectives</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>Simplifying the Licensure and credentialing process for self-sponsored members and solving problems that could arise during its course.
          </li>
          <li>A 100 percent pass rate with students registered with the Academy for the NCLEX Review.
        </li>
        <li>Creating a platform where nurses can network; inspiring and supporting each other through the process.
        </li>
        <li>Guiding members through every step of the Licensure process.
        </li>
        <li>Having members make Smart financial decision on payment processes during the course of Licensure.
          </li>
        </ol>
