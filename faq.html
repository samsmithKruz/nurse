          <span>
            Does Sajpointe Academy Offer Services as the filling of CGFNS CES
            forms, it can be real complex and confusing.
          </span>
        </h5>
        <p>
          Yes we do, we offer every service that would help get our clients
          licensed as USRNs.
        </p>

        <h5>
          <span>
            Can I get to buy the FBI standard fingerprint cards from Sajpointe
            Academy.
          </span>
        </h5>
        <p>
          Yes, Sajpointe Academy makes available the FBI Standard finger print
          cards at a very affordable rate, Simply select this service on the
          Home page of the Website or hit the CLICK FOR CONSULT button on the
          home page and we will get to you.
        </p>

        <h5>
          <span>
            Why are we advised to use the CGFNS CES instead of other Evaluation
            Body, it takes a longer time with CGFNS.
          </span>
        </h5>
        <p>
          We advise our client to use the CGFNS CES because after the NCLEX and
          you hit the immigration phase, you would need to apply for a
          VisaScreen Certificate with CGFNS, if another Evaluation body was used
          prior, you would have to pay extra and start your Credential
          Evaluation from scratch again with CGFNS. This is because only CGFNS
          offers the VisaScreen Certificate. This will cost more time and
          money.However, there are client who still opt for other Evaluation
          bodies such as ERES due to certain reasons that are unique to them. We
          help such clients also with the Registration.
        </p>

        <h5>
          <span>
            Why are Nigerians advised to take the NCLEX in Philippines.
          </span>
        </h5>
        <p>
          Other countries such as the US, UK, CANADA, INDIA, and the likes do
          not grant Visas to Nigerians on the basis of writing NCLEX. If you are
          denied a Visa to the US this might affect you during the immigration
          phase, at the level of the USCIS, so we advise clients to take the
          test in the Philippines. There is 100 percent assurance you would get
          the Philippine visa for NCLEX, it is fast and very affordable. It is
          best to save yourself the stress of thinking through the reason for a
          denied visa and how to apply again with other countries.
        </p>

        <h5>
          <span>
            After self-sponsoring myself for the NCLEX, is it still important I
            apply to an Agency for the remaining Phase.
          </span>
        </h5>
        <p>
          Yes it is. For you to be issued an Employment Based Visa or a Green
          card to work as a Nurse in the USA, a Nurse Recruitment Agency or US
          based Hospital has to file the i140 Petition on your behalf with the
          USCIS. You cannot do this on your own.
        </p>

        <h5>
          <span>
            How fast is the remaining phase of the process after passing the
            NCLEX.
          </span>
        </h5>
        <p>
          Well this is influenced by a lot of factors we cannot control most of
          the time. The major delay Nurses tend to face after passing the NCLEX
          is with the USCIS. Denials in your petition, Request For Evidence and
          the likes can pose a delay in your process, also the NVC stage can be
          real slow sometimes. Priority Date could also cause a delay, but be
          rest assured we are not affected by this, at least not for now as our
          PD is current. Delays can also be from the part of the agencies, could
          be they don’t have a job placement for you yet, or there is a policy
          you finish a particular transition course before deployment and you
          are behind. A lot of things could cause a delay, but the most common
          is the USCIS. This is the toughest stage of the whole immigration
          process, after crossing this stage, it’s always a smooth sail with the
          other process.
        </p>

        <h5>
          <span>
            What Agency would you advise a self-sponsored Nurse to sign up with
            after the NCLEX.
          </span>
        </h5>
        <p>
          Well, no agency is perfect; every agency has its own pros and cons.
          Your choice of an agency should be dependent on what you place as
          priority amongst a list of other things. There are different contract
          terms with Agencies and the best we can do as a company when you get a
          Consult is familiarize you with all that is at stake based on our
          firsthand experience with them so far. This is the best you can get
          and it is all you need. In the end you get to make the decision
          yourself, but be sure it would be a Well-Informed one.
        </p>

        <h5>
          <span>
            When can I apply to be recruited by an agency again, after I was
            turned down
          </span>
        </h5>
        <p>
          This is dependent on the reason you were not recruited. Some agencies
          even tell you when you should apply again based on their assessment of
          you and when they feel you could meet their requirement. However,
          Sajpointe Academy advices you seek proper consult before you submit an
          application to any US recruitment agency, to avoid such delays as this
          and also give you a better chance of being recruited.
        </p>

        <h5>
          <span>
            I don’t stay in Abuja or Lagos, and i am aware i have to travel to
            make submission of my CGFNS License Validation form and make
            necessary payment, are there other ways to go about this.
          </span>
        </h5>
        <p>
          Yes! Sajpointe Academy helps you carry this out without any hassle on
          your own part. It saves you money, it is less stressful and most of
          all you don’t get on that risk of travelling long distances. Kindly
          hit the CLICK FOR CONSULT on the Home page, select the service and we
          will be at your aid.
