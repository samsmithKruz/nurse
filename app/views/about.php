    <h4>The Struggle</h4>
    <p>
    Internationally trained nurses have struggled with the complex process of nursing credentialing and licensure in the US, feeling overwhelmed by NCLEX preparation, making their dreams and desire of practicing in the US somewhat unrealistic and unachievable. The most challenging aspects of the journey are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Lack of appropriate information.</li>
      <li>Financial constraints.</li>
      <li>Overwhelming credentialing and licensure process.</li>
      <li>Longer duration of time to complete the entire process.</li>
      <li>Bulky and numerous NCLEX materials.</li>
      <li>Fear of the unknown.</li>
      <li>Some don't believe it is possible to make it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      These factors might seem intangible or somewhat unrealistic but has completely dashed the hope of young vibrant nurses of great intellectual capacity and exceptional passion for the health field, to thrive for greater opportunities.
