    <h5>

        Why are we advised to use the CGFNS CES instead of other Evaluation
        Body, it takes a longer time with CGFNS.
      </span>
    </h5>
    <p>
      We advise our client to use the CGFNS CES because after the NCLEX and
      you hit the immigration phase, you would need to apply for a
      VisaScreen Certificate with CGFNS, if another Evaluation body was used
      prior, you would have to pay extra and start your Credential
      Evaluation from scratch again with CGFNS. This is because only CGFNS
      offers the VisaScreen Certificate. This will cost more time and
      money.However, there are client who still opt for other Evaluation
      bodies such as ERES due to certain reasons that are unique to them. We
      help such clients also with the Registration.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <span>
        Why are Nigerians advised to take the NCLEX in Philippines.
      </span>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Other countries such as the US, UK, CANADA, INDIA, and the likes do
      not grant Visas to Nigerians on the basis of writing NCLEX. If you are
      denied a Visa to the US this might affect you during the immigration
      phase, at the level of the USCIS, so we advise clients to take the
      test in the Philippines. There is 100 percent assurance you would get
      the Philippine visa for NCLEX, it is fast and very affordable. It is
      best to save yourself the stress of thinking through the reason for a
      denied visa and how to apply again with other countries.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <span>
        After self-sponsoring myself for the NCLEX, is it still important I
        apply to an Agency for the remaining Phase.
      </span>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes it is. For you to be issued an Employment Based Visa or a Green
      card to work as a Nurse in the USA, a Nurse Recruitment Agency or US
      based Hospital has to file the i140 Petition on your behalf with the
      USCIS. You cannot do this on your own.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <span>
        How fast is the remaining phase of the process after passing the
        NCLEX.
      </span>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Well this is influenced by a lot of factors we cannot control most of
      the time. The major delay Nurses tend to face after passing the NCLEX
      is with the USCIS. Denials in your petition, Request For Evidence and
      the likes can pose a delay in your process, also the NVC stage can be
      real slow sometimes. Priority Date could also cause a delay, but be
      rest assured we are not affected by this, at least not for now as our
      PD is current. Delays can also be from the part of the agencies, could
      be they don’t have a job placement for you yet, or there is a policy
      you finish a particular transition course before deployment and you
      are behind. A lot of things could cause a delay, but the most common
      is the USCIS. This is the toughest stage of the whole immigration
      process, after crossing this stage, it’s always a smooth sail with the
      other process.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <span>
        What Agency would you advise a self-sponsored Nurse to sign up with
        after the NCLEX.
      </span>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Well, no agency is perfect; every agency has its own pros and cons.
      Your choice of an agency should be dependent on what you place as
      priority amongst a list of other things. There are different contract
      terms with Agencies and the best we can do as a company when you get a
      Consult is familiarize you with all that is at stake based on our
      firsthand experience with them so far. This is the best you can get
      and it is all you need. In the end you get to make the decision
      yourself, but be sure it would be a Well-Informed one.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <span>
        When can I apply to be recruited by an agency again, after I was
        turned down
      </span>
    </h5>
    <p>
      This is dependent on the reason you were not recruited. Some agencies
      even tell you when you should apply again based on their assessment of
      you and when they feel you could meet their requirement. However,
      Sajpointe Academy advices you seek proper consult before you submit an
      application to any US recruitment agency, to avoid such delays as this
      and also give you a better chance of being recruited.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <span>
        I don’t stay in Abuja or Lagos, and i am aware i have to travel to
        make submission of my CGFNS License Validation form and make
        necessary payment, are there other ways to go about this.
      </span>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Yes! Sajpointe Academy helps you carry this out without any hassle on
      your own part. It saves you money, it is less stressful and most of
      all you don’t get on that risk of travelling long distances. Kindly
